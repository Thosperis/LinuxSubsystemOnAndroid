Python sends commands/frames/meta over a port
Android Java turns that into GLES drawing
GLES renders into a SurfaceView 

so python doesnt capture anything, its just telling the surfaceview to display these frames here
it does not matter if the controller of the frames for the live view is slow or not because it just needs to show what it is exactly for PhoneUI
